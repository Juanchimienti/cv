## Experience:

### [Freelance SRE/Devops](https://github.com/Juanchimienti/cv)

#### March 2018 to present

Working as a freelance SRE to help companies implement and improve their
infrastructure.
The main clients being Skilynx, Grupo Octubre, Axometrica, Gehl, HXE,
Poringa, TicketHoy, Impremedia, Djmagla, Bancolombia.

###### Skilynx

Skilynx is "The gold standard for resort experiences". The role here started
mainly as DevOps for the backend app and today I'm also adding value as an
Android developer. The backend is built on top of CakePHP and uses RDS Aurora,
Elastic Beanstalk and ElastiCache.

###### Grupo Octubre

In Grupo Octubre I started as SRE for the Pagina/12 Newspaper. I found a
neglected infrastructure, without automation for most of the process, even
deploys where done manually. I migrated the whole Infrastructure to a
Kubernetes (GKE) using Helm Charts for all the services, Jenkins for CI/CD,
Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring. Then we as a team started helping
other sites inside the group but they where hosted on SaaS/PaaS so the role
shifted.

###### Others

Many smaller projects with few different roles. For example as a Project
Manager for Gehl where I help the UX/UI & Dev teams deliver new features to a
Ruby webapp. Then for HXE I designed and implemented the whole infrastructure
for a new app to survey companies carbon emissions. Then as developer for
Bancolombia where I made some integrations with google calendar/yahoo weather
etc on Python for a virtual assistant that would greet you when you arrived at
the office.


### [Taringa!](http://www.taringa.net)

#### February 2014 until november 2017, Head of site performance & reliability


From Head to sysadmin to SRE in milliseconds would be an
accurate way to describe the position. A very small team with huge challenges.

More than 150 servers born and raised with little (to none) automation and even
without versioning in the configuration files handled by a team of two.
Up to 60 million users accessing the site each month, 50,000 requests per minute
and the challenge to stop treating servers as unique pieces and automating
the provisioning tasks.


###### Technologies Used
GNU/Linux, Mysql, nginx, kubernetes, memcached, zabbix, thumbor, docker, redis,
sphinx, fabfile, vertx, MongoDB, rabbitmq, nodejs, prometheus, grafana,
Cloudflare, ELK, AWS (ec2,s3,rds),Google Cloud (GKE, Google Cloud SQL)


### [GrupoMost](http://www.grupomost.com)


#### August 2004 until january 2014, Infrastructure and technology team
In the almost ten years at GrupoMost I had different positions with different
tasks, from installation and configuration of different technologies to
teaching, guidance and coordination of the team.
There were 4 different periods marked by the tasks and responsibilities. The
first as a sysadmin, then as a DBA, the third as head of the Database Team (a
three DBA team) and finally as head of technology in charge of 10 nerds.

##### December 2012 - January 2014 Head of technology team
> The biggest challenge here was to adjust the needs of the different clients
to the best technical solutions within the budget. The next one was to help
everyone understand what our team did and help the team get better.
We accomplished that by implementing detailed task logging and measurement.
This allowed the team to see which tasks were taking most of our efforts and
the rest of the company which clients were more demanding.


##### July 2010 - June 2012 Head of DB Team
> In this position I started to learn my management, leadership and coaching
skills. The team was composed by 2 junior DBAs and 1 senior. A big part of the
day to day was to teach and coach the juniors, one of which studied and approved
the OCA Certification.

###### Technologies Used

Dataguard, postgreSql, Oracle APEX, Oracle Weblogic.

specialized in databases, mainly Oracle DB.

clients) versions 8,9,10 & 11.

- Installation, configuration and maintenance of standby with Dataguard.
- Development and maintenance of standby synchronization scripts for Oracle
standard edition.
- Analysis of Infrastructure to propose license adjustments/improvements.
