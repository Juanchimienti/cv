### [Taringa!](http://www.taringa.net)

#### February 2014 until november 2017, Head of site performance & reliability


From Head to sysadmin to SRE in milliseconds would be an
accurate way to describe the position. A very small team with huge challenges.

More than 150 servers born and raised with little (to none) automation and even
without versioning in the configuration files handled by a team of two.
Up to 60 million users accessing the site each month, 50,000 requests per minute
and the challenge to stop treating servers as unique pieces and automating
the provisioning tasks.


###### Technologies Used

sphinx, vertx, MongoDB, rabbitmq, nodejs, prometheus, grafana, Cloudflare, ELK


### [GrupoMost](http://www.grupomost.com)


#### August 2004 until january 2014, Infrastructure and technology team
In the almost ten years at GrupoMost I had different positions with different
tasks, from installation and configuration of different technologies to
teaching, guidance and coordination of the team.
There were 4 different periods marked by the tasks and responsibilities. The
first as a sysadmin, then as a DBA, the third as head of the Database Team (a
three DBA team) and finally as head of technology in charge of 10 nerds.

##### December 2012 - January 2014 Head of technology team
> The biggest challenge here was to adjust the needs of the different clients
to the best technical solutions within the budget. The next one was to help
everyone understand what our team did and help the team get better.
We accomplished that by implementing detailed task logging and measurement.
This allowed the team to see which tasks were taking most of our efforts and
the rest of the company which clients were more demanding.


##### July 2010 - June 2012 Head of DB Team
> In this position I started to learn my management, leadership and coaching
skills. The team was composed by 2 junior DBAs and 1 senior. A big part of the

the OCA Certification.
